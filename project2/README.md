# Project 2

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

A very barebones single page Slack like app with the following files:
- application.py: The backend with routes for index page, api's to get channel info and socket connection routes as well as saving current channel info in memory
- template/index.html: Basic html layout for index page
- static/index.js: Page containing majority of logic including what is rendered, retrieving info from backend via api/socket and sending info to backend
- static/style.css: Basic styling for messages

- Personal touch: Channels' status' can be set/updated and the app remembers the status and user who updated the status
